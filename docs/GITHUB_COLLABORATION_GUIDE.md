## Introduction: The "Why" Behind Collaborative Workflow {#introduction}

### Why We Use a Structured Workflow

Welcome to the Qylon team! As a junior developer, you're joining a sophisticated AI automation platform with 8 microservices, each serving a specific purpose. Our collaborative workflow isn't just about following rules‚Äîit's about building software that works reliably for our users.

**The Cardinal Rules:**

- üö´ **NEVER** push directly to `main` or `develop`
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** work in feature branches
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** test your changes before submitting
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** get code review before merging

### Understanding Our Branch Strategy

```
main (production-ready)
  ‚Üë
develop (integration branch)
  ‚Üë
feature/your-feature-name (your work)
```

- **`main`**: The production-ready code that users interact with
- **`develop`**: Where all features are integrated and tested together
- **`feature/*`**: Your personal workspace for new features

### The Qylon Team Structure

Before diving in, understand who you're working with:

- **Bill (Chief Architect)**: Security Framework, Meeting Intelligence, Workflow Automation
- **Wilson**: User Management, Client Management
- **King**: Frontend Dashboard and UI Components
- **Ayo**: Integration Management, Video Platform Integrations
- **John**: Notification Service, Analytics & Reporting
- **Favour**: UI/UX Design and User Experience
- **Tekena**: Quality Assurance and Testing Infrastructure

## Module 1: Setting Up Your Local Workspace for Success {#module-1}

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the Qylon repository
git clone https://github.com/KD-Squares/qylon.git
cd qylon
```

### Step 2: Understanding Remotes

When you clone, Git automatically creates a remote called `origin` that points to the GitHub repository. You can verify this:

```bash
git remote -v
# Should show:
# origin  https://github.com/KD-Squares/qylon.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/KD-Squares/qylon.git (push)
```

### Step 3: First-Time Sync

Before you start any work, ensure your local environment is perfectly up-to-date:

```bash
# Check out the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Pull the latest changes from the remote develop branch
git pull origin develop

# Verify you're on the latest commit
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 4: Set Up Your Development Environment

Qylon is a complex microservices platform. Follow these steps to get everything running:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment files
cp env.example .env
cp services/api-gateway/.env.example services/api-gateway/.env
cp services/security/.env.example services/security/.env
cp services/meeting-intelligence/.env.example services/meeting-intelligence/.env
cp services/workflow-automation/.env.example services/workflow-automation/.env

# Start the development environment
docker-compose up -d postgres redis mongodb
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

### Step 5: Verify Your Setup

Test that everything is working:

```bash
# Start all services
npm run dev

# In another terminal, test the API Gateway
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

---

## Module 2: The Feature Branch Lifecycle: Your Day-to-Day Workflow {#module-2}

### Creating a Feature Branch

Always create your feature branch from the latest `develop`:

```bash
# Make sure you're on develop and it's up-to-date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create and switch to your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-user-authentication

# Push the new branch to remote (first time only)
git push -u origin feature/add-user-authentication
```

### Qylon Branch Naming Conventions

Follow these patterns for branch names:

```bash
# Features
feature/add-login-button
feature/implement-meeting-transcription
feature/add-workflow-automation

# Bug fixes
bugfix/fix-header-typo
bugfix/resolve-api-gateway-timeout
bugfix/fix-database-connection-issue

# Hotfixes (for production issues)
hotfix/security-vulnerability-patch
hotfix/critical-api-endpoint-fix

# Service-specific work
feature/security-service-api-keys
feature/meeting-intelligence-speaker-diarization
```

### Working Within Your Feature Branch

#### Atomic Commits: Small, Focused Changes

Make small, logical commits that tell a story:

```bash
# ‚ùå BAD: One giant commit
git add .
git commit -m "Added everything"

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Multiple focused commits
git add services/security/src/middleware/auth.ts
git commit -m "Add JWT token validation middleware"

git add services/security/src/routes/auth.ts
git commit -m "Implement user authentication endpoints"

git add services/security/__tests__/auth.test.ts
git commit -m "Add comprehensive auth middleware tests"
```

#### Writing Professional Commit Messages

Use the conventional commit format that Qylon follows:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
# Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

# Examples:
git commit -m "feat(security): add API key management endpoints"
git commit -m "fix(api-gateway): resolve timeout issues in proxy middleware"
git commit -m "test(meeting-intelligence): add integration tests for transcription service"
git commit -m "docs(workflow-automation): update state machine documentation"
```

#### Detailed Commit Messages

For complex changes, use a detailed commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(security): implement comprehensive API key management

- Add CRUD operations for API keys
- Implement key rotation and expiration
- Add rate limiting per API key
- Include comprehensive test coverage
- Update API documentation

Resolves: #123"
```

### Pushing Your Work

```bash
# After making commits, push to your feature branch
git push origin feature/add-user-authentication

# If you've already pushed the branch before, just use:
git push
```

---

## Module 3: Keeping Your Branch Healthy and Up-to-Date {#module-3}

### Why Regular Syncing is Critical

In a team environment, `develop` is constantly changing as other developers merge their features. If you don't sync regularly, you'll face "merge hell" when it's time to submit your PR.

### The Safe Sync Process

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always do this in your feature branch, never in develop!**

```bash
# 1. Make sure your current work is committed
git status
# If you have uncommitted changes, commit them first:
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: saving current progress before sync"

# 2. Switch to develop and pull latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 3. Switch back to your feature branch
git checkout feature/add-user-authentication

# 4. Merge develop into your feature branch
git merge develop
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts during the sync:

```bash
# Git will show you which files have conflicts
git status
# You'll see: "both modified: services/security/src/middleware/auth.ts"

# Open the conflicted file and look for conflict markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Your changes
=======
// Changes from develop
>>>>>>> develop

# Edit the file to resolve the conflict, then:
git add services/security/src/middleware/auth.ts
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in auth middleware"
```

### When to Sync

- **Daily**: If you're working on a feature for multiple days
- **Before major changes**: Before refactoring or adding new dependencies
- **Before creating a PR**: Always sync before submitting for review
- **After other PRs are merged**: Check if any merged PRs affect your work

---

## Module 4: Quality Control: Testing Your Feature {#module-4}

### Qylon Testing Strategy

Qylon has a comprehensive testing setup with multiple layers:

#### 1. Linting and Code Quality

```bash
# Run ESLint to check code quality
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix

# Check code formatting
npm run format -- --check
```

#### 2. Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run tests for a specific service
cd services/security
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

#### 3. Integration Tests

```bash
# Start test services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Stop test services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
```

#### 4. Service-Specific Testing

For the service you're working on:

```bash
# Security Service
cd services/security
npm test
npm run test:integration

# Meeting Intelligence Service
cd services/meeting-intelligence
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/

# Workflow Automation Service
cd services/workflow-automation
npm test
npm run test:state-machine
```

### Writing Tests for Your Feature

**Qylon Rule: Every new feature must include tests.**

#### Example: Testing a New API Endpoint

```typescript
// services/security/__tests__/api-keys.test.ts
import request from 'supertest';
import { app } from '../src/index';

describe('API Key Management', () => {
  let authToken: string;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Set up test data
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/auth/login')
      .send({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password' });
    authToken = response.body.token;
  });

  it('should create a new API key', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api-keys')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
      .send({
        name: 'Test API Key',
        permissions: ['read', 'write'],
      });

    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('api_key');
    expect(response.body.name).toBe('Test API Key');
  });

  it('should validate API key permissions', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Pre-PR Checklist

Before submitting your PR, run this checklist:

```bash

## Module 6: Navigating the Code Review Process {#module-6}

### What to Expect During Code Review

Code reviews in the Qylon team are thorough and constructive. Here's what you might encounter:

#### Types of Feedback

1. **Style and Standards**
```

"Please use TypeScript interfaces instead of 'any' types"
"Follow the existing error handling pattern in this service"

```

2. **Architecture and Design**
```

"This logic should be moved to a separate service method"
"Consider using the existing authentication middleware"

```

3. **Security Concerns**
```

"This endpoint needs authentication middleware"
"API keys should be hashed before storage"

```

4. **Performance and Optimization**
```

"This query could be optimized with proper indexing"
"Consider caching this response"

```

5. **Testing Requirements**
```

"Please add tests for the error cases"
"Integration tests needed for this workflow"

````

### Responding to Feedback

#### When You Agree with Feedback

```markdown
# In your response:
‚úÖ Good catch! I'll fix that.

# Make the change and push:
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address code review feedback - use proper TypeScript types"
git push
````

#### When You Have Questions

```markdown
# Ask for clarification:

ü§î I'm not sure I understand. Could you clarify what you mean by "use the existing pattern"?
I was following the pattern I saw in the auth middleware, but maybe I'm missing something?
```

#### When You Disagree (Respectfully)

```markdown
# Explain your reasoning:

üí≠ I considered that approach, but I chose this implementation because:

1. It's more consistent with the existing codebase
2. It handles edge cases better
3. It's more testable

What do you think? Should we discuss this in a quick call?
```

### Making Changes After Review

```bash
# Make the requested changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address code review feedback - implement proper error handling"

# Push the changes (they'll automatically update the PR)
git push origin feature/add-user-authentication
```

### Handling Multiple Rounds of Review

It's normal to have 2-3 rounds of review, especially for complex features:

1. **Round 1**: Major architectural and security issues
2. **Round 2**: Code style and testing improvements
3. **Round 3**: Final polish and edge cases

### When Your PR is Approved

Once you get the green light:

1. **Don't merge it yourself** - wait for a team member to merge
2. **Clean up your branch** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git branch -d feature/add-user-authentication
   git push origin --delete feature/add-user-authentication
   ```

## Module 7: Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them: A Junior Developer's Survival Guide {#module-7}

### The .gitignore File: Your Safety Net

Qylon has a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that prevents unwanted files from being committed:

```bash
# Check what's being ignored
git status --ignored

# If you accidentally commit something that should be ignored:
git rm --cached .env
git commit -m "Remove accidentally committed environment file"
```

**Common files that should NEVER be committed:**

- `.env` files (contain secrets)
- `node_modules/` (dependencies)
- `*.log` files (logs)
- `dist/` or `build/` folders (compiled code)
- IDE-specific files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)

### "Do Not Touch": Protecting the Core Framework

**Qylon Service Boundaries - DO NOT CROSS:**

```
üö´ NEVER modify these without explicit permission:
- services/api-gateway/ (Bill's responsibility)
- database/migrations/ (Bill's responsibility)
- infrastructure/terraform/ (Bill's responsibility)
- .github/workflows/ (Bill's responsibility)
```

**What you CAN modify:**

- Your assigned service directory
- Tests for your service
- Documentation for your features
- Configuration files for your service

### Avoiding Remote Catastrophes

#### 1. Accidental Sync Prevention

```bash
# ‚ùå DANGEROUS: This could overwrite remote develop
git checkout develop
git reset --hard origin/develop  # DON'T DO THIS

# ‚úÖ SAFE: Always pull, never reset
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

#### 2. The Danger of Force Pushing

```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER do this on shared branches
git push --force origin develop
git push --force origin main

# ‚úÖ Force push is only safe on your personal feature branches
git push --force origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 3. Branching from the Wrong Place

```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG: Branching from another feature branch
git checkout feature/someone-elses-work
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Always branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

### Common Git Mistakes and How to Fix Them

#### 1. Committed to the Wrong Branch

```bash
# If you committed to develop instead of your feature branch:
git log --oneline -3  # Find your commit hash
git checkout develop
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove the commit from develop
git checkout feature/your-feature
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # Apply it to your feature branch
```

#### 2. Forgot to Pull Before Starting Work

```bash
# If you started work on an outdated develop:
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/your-feature
git rebase develop  # This will replay your commits on top of the latest develop
```

#### 3. Accidentally Deleted Important Files

```bash
# Git keeps a history of all changes:
git log --oneline --follow -- path/to/deleted/file
git checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/deleted/file
```

### Emergency Recovery Commands

```bash
# See what you've changed
git status
git diff

# Undo uncommitted changes
git checkout -- <file>  # Undo changes to specific file
git reset --hard HEAD   # Undo ALL uncommitted changes (DANGEROUS)

# Undo the last commit (but keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo the last commit (and lose changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# See the history of your branch
git log --oneline --graph
```

## Qylon-Specific Best Practices {#qylon-specific}

### Understanding the Microservices Architecture

Qylon consists of 8 independent services. Each service has:

- **Own database tables** (with RLS policies)
- **Own API endpoints** (routed through API Gateway)
- **Own test suite**
- **Own deployment configuration**

### Service Development Guidelines

#### 1. Service Boundaries

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Service communicates through API Gateway
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/security/api-keys', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});

// ‚ùå WRONG: Direct service-to-service communication
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api-keys', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});
```

#### 2. Error Handling Standards

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Qylon error handling pattern
try {
  const result = await someOperation();
  logger.info('Operation successful', { operationId: result.id });
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', {
    error: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
  });
  throw new APIError('Operation failed', 500, { originalError: error });
}
```

#### 3. Authentication and Authorization

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Always validate authentication
app.use('/api', authenticateToken);

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Check permissions
const hasPermission = await checkUserPermission(userId, 'api-keys:write');
if (!hasPermission) {
  throw new APIError('Insufficient permissions', 403);
}
```

### Database Best Practices

#### 1. Always Use Migrations

```bash
# Create a new migration
npm run db:create-migration add-api-keys-table

# The migration file will be created in database/migrations/
```

#### 2. Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Always enable RLS
CREATE TABLE api_keys (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  key_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE api_keys ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own API keys" ON api_keys
  FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### Testing Standards

#### 1. Test Structure

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Qylon test structure
describe('API Key Management', () => {
  let testUser: User;
  let authToken: string;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    testUser = await createTestUser();
    authToken = await generateAuthToken(testUser.id);
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await cleanupTestData();
  });

  describe('POST /api-keys', () => {
    it('should create API key with valid data', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should reject invalid permissions', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

#### 2. Integration Testing

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Test through API Gateway
describe('API Gateway Integration', () => {
  it('should route API key requests to security service', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/security/api-keys')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
      .send({ name: 'Test Key', permissions: ['read'] });

    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('api_key');
  });
});
```

### Environment Configuration

#### 1. Service-Specific Environment Files

```bash
# Each service has its own .env file
services/security/.env
services/meeting-intelligence/.env
services/workflow-automation/.env
```

#### 2. Environment Variable Naming

```bash
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use service prefix
SECURITY_SERVICE_PORT=3001
SECURITY_SERVICE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# ‚ùå WRONG: Generic names
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues {#troubleshooting}

### Development Environment Issues

#### 1. Services Won't Start

```bash
# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :3001

# Kill processes using ports
kill -9 <PID>

# Restart Docker services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d postgres redis mongodb
```

#### 2. Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps postgres

# Check database logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d postgres
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

#### 3. Environment Variable Issues

```bash
# Check if .env files exist
ls -la .env
ls -la services/*/.env

# Verify environment variables are loaded
node -e "console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL)"
```

### Git Issues

#### 1. Merge Conflicts

```bash
# See which files have conflicts
git status

# Resolve conflicts in your editor, then:
git add <resolved-file>
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in <file>"
```

#### 2. Accidentally Committed Secrets

```bash
# Remove from Git history (if recent)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset HEAD .env
git commit -m "Remove accidentally committed environment file"

# Add to .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .env to .gitignore"
```

#### 3. Lost Work

```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# Recover lost commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
git checkout -b recovery-branch

# Or cherry-pick specific commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Testing Issues

#### 1. Tests Failing Locally

```bash
# Clear test database
npm run db:reset

# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose

# Run specific test file
npm test -- services/security/__tests__/auth.test.ts
```

#### 2. Integration Test Issues

```bash
# Ensure test services are running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# View test logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs
```
