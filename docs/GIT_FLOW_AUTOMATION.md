# Qylon Git-Flow Automation Guide

## üéØ Overview

This document describes the automated Git-flow process implemented for the Qylon AI Automation Platform. The system enforces local testing and validation before any Pull Request (PR) is submitted, significantly reducing CI/CD pipeline failures and associated costs.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Pre-commit Hook** - Validates code before commits
2. **Pre-push Hook** - Comprehensive validation before pushing to remote
3. **Security Scanning** - Multiple security tools integration
4. **Test Automation** - Unit, integration, and coverage validation
5. **Code Quality** - Linting, formatting, and link validation
6. **Branch Management** - Naming conventions and protection rules

### Process Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer makes changes] --> B[git add .]
    B --> C[git commit]
    C --> D[Pre-commit Hook]
    D --> E{All checks pass?}
    E -->|No| F[Commit blocked - Fix issues]
    F --> B
    E -->|Yes| G[Commit created]
    G --> H[git push]
    H --> I[Pre-push Hook]
    I --> J{All checks pass?}
    J -->|No| K[Push blocked - Fix issues]
    K --> L[Fix issues]
    L --> H
    J -->|Yes| M[Push successful]
    M --> N[Create Pull Request]
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup

Run the setup script to install all Git hooks and dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

This script will:
- Install pre-commit and pre-push hooks
- Install required dependencies
- Configure security tools
- Set up configuration files

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Validate current branch
npm run validate:branch

# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/JIRA-123-add-user-authentication
```

### 3. Development Workflow

```bash
# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit (triggers pre-commit hook)
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system"

# Push (triggers pre-push hook)
git push origin feature/JIRA-123-add-user-authentication
```

## üìã Validation Checks

### Pre-commit Hook Checks

The pre-commit hook runs the following validations:

#### 1. Branch Management
- ‚úÖ Prevents direct commits to protected branches (`main`, `develop`, `master`)
- ‚úÖ Validates branch naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Enforces feature/bugfix/hotfix/chore prefixes

#### 2. Code Formatting and Linting
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript/JavaScript**: ESLint with security rules
- ‚úÖ **Python**: Black, isort, flake8
- ‚úÖ **Code Formatting**: Prettier for consistent styling

#### 3. Link Validation
- ‚úÖ Checks internal documentation links
- ‚úÖ Validates external links (HTTP/HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ Reports broken links with context

#### 4. Unit Tests
- ‚úÖ Runs all unit tests
- ‚úÖ Enforces 80% code coverage threshold
- ‚úÖ Generates coverage reports

#### 5. Security Scan
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation security check
- ‚úÖ ESLint security analysis
- ‚úÖ NPM audit for vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Python Bandit security scan (if available)

#### 6. Integration Tests
- ‚úÖ Runs critical integration tests
- ‚úÖ Validates service interactions

### Pre-push Hook Checks

The pre-push hook includes all pre-commit checks plus:

#### 7. Enhanced Security Scan
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive npm audit
- ‚úÖ Snyk vulnerability scan (if available)
- ‚úÖ Retire.js scan (if available)
- ‚úÖ Audit-ci scan (if available)
- ‚úÖ Trivy container scan (if available)

#### 8. Build Validation
- ‚úÖ Tests build process
- ‚úÖ Validates Docker builds
- ‚úÖ Checks database migrations

#### 9. Performance Tests
- ‚úÖ Runs critical performance tests
- ‚úÖ Load testing validation

#### 10. Health Check Validation
- ‚úÖ Validates service health checks
- ‚úÖ Tests service startup

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Branch Naming Conventions

The system enforces the following branch naming patterns:

```
feature/JIRA-XXXX-short-description
bugfix/JIRA-XXXX-short-description
hotfix/JIRA-XXXX-short-description
chore/JIRA-XXXX-short-description
release/1.0.0
```

**Examples:**
- `feature/JIRA-123-add-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/JIRA-456-fix-login-bug`
- `hotfix/JIRA-789-critical-security-fix`
- `chore/JIRA-101-update-dependencies`

### Coverage Thresholds

```javascript
// jest.config.js
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 80,
    functions: 80,
    lines: 80,
    statements: 80,
  },
}
```

### Security Thresholds

```bash
# scripts/security-test.sh
CRITICAL_THRESHOLD=0    # No critical vulnerabilities allowed
HIGH_THRESHOLD=0        # No high vulnerabilities allowed
MODERATE_THRESHOLD=5    # Up to 5 moderate vulnerabilities allowed
LOW_THRESHOLD=10        # Up to 10 low vulnerabilities allowed
```

## üîß Available Scripts

### Test Scripts

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm run test:runner

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:runner:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:runner:integration

# Run only coverage analysis
npm run test:runner:coverage
```

### Validation Scripts

```bash
# Validate branch naming and status
npm run validate:branch

# Check all links
npm run validate:links

# Check only internal links
npm run validate:links:internal

# Check only external links
npm run validate:links:external
```

```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Pre-commit Hook Fails

**Problem**: Code formatting or linting issues
**Solution**:
```bash
# Fix formatting
npm run format

# Fix linting
npm run lint:fix

# For Python files
black .
isort .
flake8 .
```

#### 2. Test Coverage Below Threshold

**Problem**: Coverage below 80%
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View detailed coverage
npm run test:coverage:html
# Open coverage/index.html in browser
```

#### 3. Security Vulnerabilities

**Problem**: Security scan finds vulnerabilities
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check specific vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable issues
npm audit fix

# For Python vulnerabilities
bandit -r services/
```

#### 4. Branch Naming Issues

**Problem**: Branch doesn't follow naming convention
**Solution**:
```bash
# Rename current branch
git branch -m feature/JIRA-123-correct-name

# Or create new branch with correct name
git checkout -b feature/JIRA-123-correct-name
```

### Bypassing Hooks (Emergency Only)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Only use in emergency situations

```bash
# Skip pre-commit hook
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: critical fix"

# Skip pre-push hook
git push --no-verify origin branch-name
```

## üìä Monitoring and Reporting

### Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:
- **Terminal**: Real-time coverage during test runs
- **HTML**: `coverage/index.html` for detailed analysis
- **JSON**: `coverage/coverage-summary.json` for CI/CD integration

### Security Reports

Security scan results are available in:
- **Terminal**: Real-time vulnerability reports
- **JSON**: `bandit-report.json` for Python security issues
- **Audit logs**: npm audit output for dependency vulnerabilities

### Performance Metrics

Performance test results include:
- **Load test results**: Response times and throughput
- **Memory usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
- **CPU utilization**: Resource usage patterns

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration

The local validation system is designed to work seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run validation
        run: |
          npm run validate:branch
          npm run test:runner
          npm run security:scan
          npm run validate:links
```

### Pre-commit CI Integration

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: qylon-pre-commit
        name: Qylon Pre-commit Hook
        entry: .git/hooks/pre-commit
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        always_run: true
```

## üìö Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Always create feature branches** from `develop`
2. **Follow naming conventions** strictly
3. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
4. **Keep commits small** and focused
5. **Write descriptive commit messages**
6. **Run validation locally** before pushing

### Code Quality

1. **Maintain high test coverage** (80%+)
2. **Fix security vulnerabilities** immediately
3. **Keep dependencies updated**
4. **Use consistent formatting**
5. **Document complex logic**

### Security

1. **Never commit secrets** or API keys
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** thoroughly
4. **Keep security tools updated**
5. **Review security reports** regularly

## üÜò Support
